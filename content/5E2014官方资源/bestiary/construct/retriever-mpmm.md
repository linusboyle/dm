# Retriever
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 209*  

The retriever is a potent, spider-like Construct conceived and built by Underdark followers of Lolth for one original purpose—to prowl the Abyss and capture demons for these cultists to enslave or use in their rituals. The automatons proved so effective and so fearsome that they now perform many different missions.

Though retrievers were created to operate only in the Abyss, they are sometimes dispatched when a powerful devotee of Lolth needs some creature or object captured and brought back alive and intact. Only under the rarest of circumstances is a retriever handed over or sold to others, since Lolth's cultists don't want to take the chance that their creations will be turned against them.

## Traits

***Faultless Tracker.*** The retriever is given a quarry by its master. The quarry can be a specific creature or object the master is personally acquainted with, or it can be a general type of creature or object the master has seen before. The retriever knows the direction and distance to its quarry as long as the two of them are on the same plane of existence. The retriever can have only one such quarry at a time. The retriever also always knows the location of its master.

***Spellcasting.*** The retriever casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 13):

**3/day each**: [plane shift](5E2014官方资源/spells/plane-shift.md) (only self and up to one incapacitated creature, which is considered willing for the spell), [web](5E2014官方资源/spells/web.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The retriever makes two Foreleg attacks, and it uses Force Beam or Paralyzing Beam, if available.

***Foreleg.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+11` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (`2d8 + 6`) slashing damage.

***Force Beam.*** The retriever targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (`5d10`) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Paralyzing Beam (Recharge 5-6).*** The retriever targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be [paralyzed](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#paralyzed) for 1 minute. The [paralyzed](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#paralyzed) target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

If the [paralyzed](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#paralyzed) creature is Medium or smaller, the retriever can pick it up as part of the retriever's move and walk or climb with it at full speed.
