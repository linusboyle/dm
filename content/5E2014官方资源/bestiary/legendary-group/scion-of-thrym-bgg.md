# Scion of Thrym

## Regional effects
_Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants_

The region surrounding a scion of Thrym is altered by the giant's magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Biting Chill.** Extreme cold envelops the land within 6 miles of the scion (see the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for rules on [extreme cold](5E2014官方资源/traps-hazards/extreme-cold.md)). If the climate in the area already features extreme cold, the cold is numbing—creatures in the area without immunity or resistance to cold damage have disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks.  
- **Empowered Frost Giants.** Frost giants within 1,000 feet of the scion gain a +7 bonus to attack and damage rolls.  
- **Thriving Wildlife.** Beasts reproduce rapidly and thrive within 6 miles of the scion.  

If the scion dies, these effects end immediately.
