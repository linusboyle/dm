# Outer Essence Shard (Lawful)
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer)*  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This flickering crystal holds the essence of an Outer Plane. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can use that property.

## Property

You can end one of the following conditions affecting yourself or one creature you can see within 30 feet of you: [charmed](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#charmed), [blinded](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#blinded), [deafened](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#deafened), [frightened](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#frightened), [poisoned](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#poisoned), or [stunned](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#stunned).
