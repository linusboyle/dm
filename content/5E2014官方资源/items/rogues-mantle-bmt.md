# Rogue's Mantle
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)*  


This dark, hooded mantle of thick cloth is infused with secretive and deceptive magic. While wearing it, you gain the following benefits:

- **Darkvision.** You gain [darkvision](5E2014官方资源/规则/senses.md#darkvision) within a range of 60 feet. If you already have [darkvision](5E2014官方资源/规则/senses.md#darkvision), the mantle increases your [darkvision](5E2014官方资源/规则/senses.md#darkvision)'s range by 60 feet instead.  
- **Move in Shadows.** While you are in dim light or darkness, you can use a bonus action to teleport, along with anything you are wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end of the turn.  
- **Willful Enmity.** You can cast the [Antagonize](5E2014官方资源/spells/antagonize-bmt.md) spell (save DC 15) from the mantle. Once the mantle has cast the spell, it can't cast the spell again until the next dawn.
