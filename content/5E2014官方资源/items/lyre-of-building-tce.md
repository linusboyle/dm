# Lyre of Building
*Instrument, rare (requires attunement by a bard)*  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

While holding this [lyre](5E2014官方资源/items/lyre.md), you can cast [mending](5E2014官方资源/spells/mending.md) as an action. You can also play the [lyre](5E2014官方资源/items/lyre.md) as a reaction when an object or a structure you can see within 300 feet of you takes damage, causing it to be immune to that damage and any further damage of the same type until the start of your next turn.

In addition, you can play the [lyre](5E2014官方资源/items/lyre.md) as an action to cast [fabricate](5E2014官方资源/spells/fabricate.md), [move earth](5E2014官方资源/spells/move-earth.md), [passwall](5E2014官方资源/spells/passwall.md), or [summon construct](5E2014官方资源/spells/summon-construct-tce.md), and that spell can't be cast from it again until the next dawn.
