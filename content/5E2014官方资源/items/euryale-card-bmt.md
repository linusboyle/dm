# Euryale Card
*Wondrous Item, legendary*  


As an action, you can brandish this card at one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and attempt to turn it to stone. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, or it begins to turn to stone and has the [restrained](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#restrained) condition. The affected target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the effect ends on the target. On a failed save, the target has the [petrified](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#petrified) condition (instead of the [restrained](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#restrained) condition) until it is removed by the [Greater Restoration](5E2014官方资源/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or similar magic. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
