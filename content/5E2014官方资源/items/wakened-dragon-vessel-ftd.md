# Wakened Dragon Vessel
*Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement)*  


This vessel can be a potion bottle, drinking horn, or other container meant to hold a liquid.

As a bonus action, if the vessel is empty, you can speak the command word to fill the vessel with one of the following (your choice): ale, olive oil, mead, wine, a [potion of healing](5E2014官方资源/items/potion-of-healing.md), a [potion of greater healing](5E2014官方资源/items/potion-of-greater-healing.md), a [potion of superior healing](5E2014官方资源/items/potion-of-superior-healing.md), a [potion of climbing](5E2014官方资源/items/potion-of-climbing.md), a [potion of fire breath](5E2014官方资源/items/potion-of-fire-breath.md), or a [potion of flying](5E2014官方资源/items/potion-of-flying.md). Once this property is used, it can't be used until the next dawn. A potion you create in this way loses its magical properties if it isn't imbibed within 24 hours.
