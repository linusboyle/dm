# Euryale's Aegis
*Shield, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This gleaming brass shield bears a relief of the legendary medusa druid [Euryale](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md).

While wielding this shield, you gain the following benefits:

- **Blessing of Euryale.** You have resistance to poison damage and are immune to the [petrified](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#petrified) condition.  
- **Petrifying Heraldry.** As a bonus action, you can make the front of the shield flare with a medusa's petrifying magic, causing the relief's eyes to glow brightly. Choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, or it has the [restrained](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#restrained) condition as its body turns to stone. The [restrained](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#restrained) creature must make another DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the start of its next turn. On a failed save, the creature has the [petrified](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#petrified) condition for 24 hours. On a successful save, the [restrained](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#restrained) condition ends. Once this bonus action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.  
- **Spellcasting.** While wielding the shield, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: [Lesser Restoration](5E2014官方资源/spells/lesser-restoration.md), [Locate Creature](5E2014官方资源/spells/locate-creature.md), [Transport via Plants](5E2014官方资源/spells/transport-via-plants.md). Once you use the shield to cast a spell, the shield can't cast that spell again until the next dawn.
