# Spray of Cards
*2nd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (15-feet cone)
- **Components:** V, S, a deck of cards
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You spray a 15-foot cone of spectral cards. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `2d10` force damage and has the [blinded](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#blinded) condition until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d10` for each slot level above 2nd.

**Classes**: [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](5E2014官方资源/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](5E2014官方资源/classes/rogue-arcane-trickster.md)
