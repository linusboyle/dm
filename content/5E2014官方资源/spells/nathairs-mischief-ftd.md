| dice: d4 | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | The smell of apple pie fills the air, and each creature in the cube must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become [charmed](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#charmed) by you until the start of your next turn. |
| 2 | Bouquets of flowers appear all around, and each creature in the cube must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be [blinded](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#blinded) until the start of your next turn as the flowers spray water in their faces. |
| 3 | Each creature in the cube must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or begin giggling until the start of your next turn. A giggling creature is [incapacitated](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#incapacitated) and uses all its movement to move in a random direction. |
| 4 | Drops of molasses hover in the cube, making it difficult terrain until the start of your next turn. |
