# Raulothim's Psychic Lance
*4th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash a shimmering lance of psychic power from your forehead at a creature that you can see within range. Alternatively, you can utter a creature's name. If the named target is within range, it becomes the spell's target even if you can't see it. If the named target isn't within range, the lance dissipates without effect.

The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes `7d6` psychic damage and is [incapacitated](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#incapacitated) until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't [incapacitated](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#incapacitated).

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 4th.

**Classes**: [Bard](5E2014官方资源/classes/bard.md), [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](5E2014官方资源/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](5E2014官方资源/classes/rogue-arcane-trickster.md), [Sorcerer](5E2014官方资源/classes/sorcerer.md), [Warlock](5E2014官方资源/classes/warlock.md), [Wizard](5E2014官方资源/classes/wizard.md)
