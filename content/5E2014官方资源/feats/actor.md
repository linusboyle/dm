# Actor
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 165*  

Skilled at mimicry and dramatics, you gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on Charisma ([Deception](5E2014官方资源/规则/skills.md#Deception)) and Charisma ([Performance](5E2014官方资源/规则/skills.md#Performance)) checks when trying to pass yourself off as a different person.  
- You can mimic the speech of another person or the sounds made by other creatures. You must have heard the person speaking, or heard the creature make the sound, for at least 1 minute. A successful Wisdom ([Insight](5E2014官方资源/规则/skills.md#Insight)) check contested by your Charisma ([Deception](5E2014官方资源/规则/skills.md#Deception)) check allows a listener to determine that the effect is faked.
