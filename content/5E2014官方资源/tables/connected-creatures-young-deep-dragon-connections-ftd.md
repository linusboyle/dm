| dice: d6 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | A [young deep dragon](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/dragon/young-deep-dragon-ftd.md) has captured a number of [kuo-toa](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/humanoid/kuo-toa.md) and has decided to try them out as servants instead of eating them. |
| 2 | A [young deep dragon](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/dragon/young-deep-dragon-ftd.md) maintains the guise of a handsome Humanoid artist so as to maintain an adoring cult of drow and duergar admirers. |
| 3 | A rather snooty [bone naga](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/undead/bone-naga-spirit.md) serves as a [young deep dragon's](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/dragon/young-deep-dragon-ftd.md) loyal butler, as it did for the dragon's parent. |
| 4 | A [young deep dragon](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/dragon/young-deep-dragon-ftd.md) has organized a society of hobgoblin explorers, whose members seek out new places in the Underdark for the dragon to visit. |
| 5 | A [doppelganger](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/monstrosity/doppelganger.md) mimics a [young deep dragon's](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/dragon/young-deep-dragon-ftd.md) Humanoid form while committing a string of murders, hoping to turn local Underdark settlements against the dragon. |
| 6 | Despite repeated [mind flayer](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer.md) attacks, a [young deep dragon](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/dragon/young-deep-dragon-ftd.md) refuses to leave the cave where the dragon's best friend—an adventurer who won the dragon's respect and affection—lingers as a [ghost](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/undead/ghost.md). |
