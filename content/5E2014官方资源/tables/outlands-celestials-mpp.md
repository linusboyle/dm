**Outlands Celestials**

`dice: [](outlands-celestials-mpp.md#^outlands-celestials)`

| dice: d4 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | An [empyrean](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/celestial/empyrean.md) calls for aid in taking back a corner of the Outlands overrun by demons. |
| 2 | Wearing grim armor and displaying a rust-colored horn, a [unicorn](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/celestial/unicorn.md) influenced by "Acheron" challenges all it encounters to mortal combat. |
| 3 | A fallen [deva](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/celestial/deva.md), now neutral aligned, is on permanent vacation. The mellow angel is a font of multiversal secrets, but it shares them only with strangers who prove themselves more relaxed than it. |
| 4 | A [couatl](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/celestial/couatl.md) influenced by "Limbo" has color-changing wings and insists passersby convince it that they're worthy of existing. If the couatl isn't convinced, it has a 50 percent chance of either attacking or wandering off. |
