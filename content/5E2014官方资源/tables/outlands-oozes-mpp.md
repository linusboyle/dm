**Outlands Oozes**

`dice: [](outlands-oozes-mpp.md#^outlands-oozes)`

| dice: d4 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | A yugoloth arms dealer has captured a hundred [gray oozes](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/ooze/gray-ooze.md) and seeks to sell them in the gate-town of Rigus as a weapon capable of destroying Acheron's floating cubes. A rival hires the characters to steal and dispose of the oozes. |
| 2 | Within a [gelatinous cube](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/ooze/gelatinous-cube.md) influenced by "Gehenna" floats a gigantic fiendish skull. Numerous Fiends revere the cube and interpret depraved schemes and threatening orders from its quivering. A Celestial seeks aid in destroying the cube. |
| 3 | A bog in a region influenced by "Carceri" is swamped with countless [black puddings](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/ooze/black-pudding.md). The characters are hired to recover a lost relic from the bottom of the bog. |
| 4 | A chef in the gate-town of "Tradegate" wants the characters to retrieve royal jelly from a hive of giant bees (use the [giant wasp](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/beast/giant-wasp.md) stat block). He doesn't note that the hive's honey takes the form of sweet-tasting [ochre jellies](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/ooze/ochre-jelly.md). |
