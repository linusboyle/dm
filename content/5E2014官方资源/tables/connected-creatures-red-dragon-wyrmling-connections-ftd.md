| 2 | A [red dragon wyrmling](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/dragon/red-dragon-wyrmling.md) adopted a nest of [fire snakes](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/elemental/fire-snake.md), which have now grown into [salamanders](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/elemental/salamander.md) who protect the wyrmling. |

| 4 | A tiefling child has secretly hidden and raised a [red dragon wyrmling](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/dragon/red-dragon-wyrmling.md) from an egg. The wyrmling is bonded to the child, but dangerous to anyone else. |
