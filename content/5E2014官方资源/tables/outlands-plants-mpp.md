| dice: d4 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | A young [treant](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/plant/treant.md) wants to put down roots. It asks the characters to help it travel around the Outlands so it can find a suitable place to call home. |
| 2 | A [myconid sovereign](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/plant/myconid-sovereign.md) has convinced a group of [githzerai monks](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/humanoid/githzerai-monk.md) to abandon their teachings and follow its path to serenity. Another githzerai hires the characters to oust the fungal guru. |
| 3 | An herbalist has cultivated a unique breed of [gas spores](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/plant/gas-spore.md). She hires the characters to convey the spores to her buyer without setting off the fungi. |
| 4 | A resident of the gate-town of "Ecstasy" is missing. His garden of [twig blights](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/plant/twig-blight.md)—influenced by "Elysium" to resemble topiary sculptures—haven't been fed and now sow chaos in town. |
