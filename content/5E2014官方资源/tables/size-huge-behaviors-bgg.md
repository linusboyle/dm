| 2 | The giant swats at a murmuration of starlings as if it were a cloud of gnats. |
| 3 | The giant uses a [dagger](5E2014官方资源/items/dagger.md) as a toothpick, a [greatsword](5E2014官方资源/items/greatsword.md) as a letter opener, or a pair of [javelins](5E2014官方资源/items/javelin.md) as knitting needles. |
| 4 | The giant carefully lifts Humanoids (cradling their heads to avoid injury) to see and hear them better. |
