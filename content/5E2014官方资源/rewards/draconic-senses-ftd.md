# Draconic Senses
*Draconic Gift, RARE*  

You gain keen senses like a dragon's.

## Blindsight

You have [blindsight](5E2014官方资源/规则/senses.md#blindsight) to a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're [blinded](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#blinded) or in darkness. Moreover, you can see [invisible](5E2014官方资源/规则/conditions.md#invisible) creatures within that range, unless the creatures successfully hide from you.

## Keen Senses

You have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](5E2014官方资源/规则/skills.md#Perception)) checks.
