# Draconic Familiar
*Draconic Gift, UNCOMMON*  

You gain the aid of a draconic familiar, which might be a splinter of the consciousness of a dragon that invested you with power.

You can cast the [find familiar](5E2014官方资源/spells/find-familiar.md) spell as a ritual without using any material components. When you cast the spell in this way, your familiar always takes the form of a [pseudodragon](5E2014官方资源/bestiary/dragon/pseudodragon.md).

Additionally, when you take the [Attack](5E2014官方资源/规则/actions.md#Attack) action on your turn, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your pseudodragon familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction.
